SVM is another alogrithm to help solve Supervised Classification Problems.

it stands for support vecotr machines

What SVMs do is find a seperating line called a hyper plane between data of 2 classes. takes data inputs and gives a line that seperates that data.

svm gives the line that maximizes the distance to the nearest points of either of the class (Margin). so that it can be in between both.
it makes it more robust


SVMs makes sure the classifications of each data point is correct first, then it wil maximize the margin.
If there is no possible decision surface, what should svm do. If there is an outlier that makes a decision surface imposible, that outlier will then be igonred by the algorithm

SVMs ignores Outliers. It mediates the ability to make a right decison surface while being robust to outliers.
